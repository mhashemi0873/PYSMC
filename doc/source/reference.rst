The goal of :mod:`pysmc` is to implement Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
techniques on top of the Monte Carlo (MC) package
`PyMC <http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc/>`_. The manual assumes that the user
is already familiar with the way PyMC works. You are advised to read their
tutorial before going on. A nice place to start with :mod:`pysmc` is
our :ref:`tutorial`.
