Welcome to pysmc's documentation!
=================================

:mod:`pysmc` is a Python package for sampling complicated probability
densities using the celebrated Sequential Monte Carlo method.
The core of this package was written during my PhD at
`Cornell University <http://www.cornell.edu>`_
at the
`Materials Process Design and Controll Laboratory <http://mpdc.mae.cornell.edu/>`_
under the
supervision of Prof. `Nicholas Zabaras <http://mpdc.mae.cornell.edu/People/ZabarasCv/Zabaras.html>`_. It is part of the 
`Bayesian Exploration Statistical Toolbox (BEST)
<http://ebilionis.github.io/py-best/html/>`_ initiative.
The coupling of the code with `PyMC <http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc/>`_ 
took part at 
the `Mathematics and Computer Science Division <http://www.mcs.anl.gov>`_
at `Argonne National Laboratory <http://www.anl.gov>`_.
